Milestone 3 Submission - Due: Monday, November 21 @ 11:55 PM
App Requirements:

Previous requirements still work
-you know it

GPS must be implemented
-Ok so here is the deal with that:
  -For some odd reason our device is updated to API level 23 (6.0.0 Marhsmallow) and NOT the API 22 5.1.1 as specified on the 
    Android project page of the course site. 
  -This issue is causing all sorts of problems which require granting of permissions at runtime. Though in our code we check for
    Our location permission BEFORE connecting to the GoogleApiClient, it seems to to do the two at the same time, causing the first 
    Instance of the App to have issues functioning because the required location permission can physically not be granted before
    It tries to connect to the API.
  -The current workaround for us is as follows.
    1)Download and install app. Accept permission for location
    2)Close App
    3)Re-open App. Now permissions will be granted and the app will function correctly
  -Everyone I have talked to (including the TA's) say they have their device at 6.0.0 so I cannot test if 5.1.1 will ask at install
    Rather than during runtime (according to https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html, under the requesting
    At runtime section, which says "If the device is running Android 5.1 or lower, or your app's target SDK is 22 or lower: If you 
    list a dangerous permission in your manifest, the user has to grant the permission when they install the app; 
    if they do not grant the permission, the system does not install the app at all.")
  -Basically, if your testing devices are using 5.1 like you say you are we will be good, if you are using 6.0.0 use the workaround
 
-What our GPS does for the purpose of this milestone

    
Local data storage must be implemented
-yes, settings stores a username

Web service must be implemented
-We are pulling images from the webservice using JSON, parsing them and displaying them 

Obvious progress towards your user requirements
