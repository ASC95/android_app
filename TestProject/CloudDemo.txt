Demonstration of App Interaction with Cloudinary Image Hosting ServiceThese are instructions for demonstrating the ability of the application to load the most recent photo uploaded to the cloud.1.	Go to “https://cloudinary.com/users/login” and login with 	asc1995@gmail.com 	cAQ12w6yzSnWHmF2.	Go to “media library” on the left side of the page3.	Select “more upload options”4.	Acquire the URL of an image you wish to display in the application, or use this URL:http://www.readthehook.com/files/old/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/news-vigilcrowd.jpg5.	Paste that URL into the remote URL field and upload6.	Once the image is uploaded, click on it to bring up detailed information about the image7.	Click “add tag” and enter “Amphitheater” exactly in the field.8.	Go back to looking at the app (without restarting it). Wait a few seconds for the image to be registered within Cloudinary’s network.9.	Click on any of the four fragments within the app, and the new image should appear because it was the most recent image uploaded with the tag “Amphitheater”. Note that any new image that you add must be tagged with “Amphitheater” in order for it to appear in the application when an ImageView is clicked on. This limitation will be changed so that we can load images from different locations around grounds in the final build.
